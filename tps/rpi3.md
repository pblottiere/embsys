## Partie 3: Flashage et UBoot

* Question
  

## Partie 5: GPIO et relais

* Question 1: There are two partition:
  - */dev/mmcblk0p1*: The root of the system, with the configuration for the boot of the os.
  - */dev/mmcblk0p2*: With the contents of the filesystem, with folder such as /etc of the root, the home and others.

* Question 2: TX is GPIO14 and RX is GPIO15, they are used for serial communication.

* Question 3: It has the following configuration:
  - Baud rate: 115200
  - Byte rate: 8 bit
  - 

* Question 4: The IP address of the board is 172.20.10.26. That was found by running the command *ip a* inside the board, after using the serial connection to access it.

* Question 5: The difference between root and user is that root is not configure through the users.table file, as the super user is always created. In order to access the root user from the ssd connection one needs first to connect with the normal user and then use the *su* command, as root access from the connection is not allowed. Another difference is that the root folder is accessible only with the root user.

* Question 6:
  - U-Boot fatload loads a binary file from a dos filesystem.
  - setenv sets the environment variables.
  - boot boots Linux zImage image from memory.


## Partie 6: I2C et BME280

* Question 1:

* Question 2:
  - VCC: input
  - GND: ground
  for the bus:
    - SCL: SCK (serial clock)
    - SDA: SDI (serial data)

* Question 3: We see the following now:
  *0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
  00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
  10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
  20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
  30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
  40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
  50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
  60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
  70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 77*

* Question 4: Page 32, we see that the slave address is 0x77.

* Question 5: 
  - For the compilation of bme280.c and linux_userspace.c we used docker.
    In order to launch it: 
    `sudo docker start "id of the docker"`
    `sudo docker exec -it "id of the docker" /bin/bash`
  
  - For the cross compilation:
    `./../buildroot-precompiled-2017.08/output/host/usr/bin/arm-linux-gcc bme 280.c linux_userspace.c -o bme`
    The output is called bme.
  
  - In order to call the sensors on the raspberry it was done `./bme dev/ipc-1`
    The values appear, but they seem frozen.
